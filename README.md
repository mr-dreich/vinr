A Valheim Server configuration tool that supports both Mac and Windows, easily create startup scripts for Valheim servers.


The program should auto detect your valheim server install if installed into the default setup, but you are able to locate it yourself if you have a custom steam directory setup. 

Once the program knows the server installation path when you click create it will add a script file to that location. Otherwise you can copy the output given and paste it into a new file yourself.


Note: This tool does not manage the server, it only creates the startup script for the server.
